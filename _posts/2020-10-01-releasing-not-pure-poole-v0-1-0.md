Polar regions are among the most sensitive components of the climate system. Arctic surface temperatures have risen at nearly four times the global mean rate, accompanied by a rapid sea-ice decline. Meantime, mid-latitude regions have experienced increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events. It remains an open question how Arctic sea-ice loss influences mid-latitude climate, complicated by strong nonlinearity and internal variability. My research seeks to clarify the dynamical connections between Arctic sea-ice decline and mid-latitude and tropical atmospheric circulation.

I found that autumn sea-ice loss north of Russia enhances wintertime atmospheric blocking circulation, leading to cold anomalies over northern Eurasia (Song et al., 2023). The results distinctly reveal a positive feedback between sea-ice-induced stratospheric circulation and intensified tropospheric blocking circulation, mediated by vertical wave propagation. In addition, I examined the combined roles of Arctic sea-ice loss and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies in driving the record-breaking rainfall over central–eastern China and Japan (Chen et al., 2021, 2022). The extreme rainfall in 2020 resulted from the persistence mid-latitude atmospheric blocking linked to Arctic sea-ice loss, together with meridional circulation convergence forced by high Indian Ocean temperature. Finally, these findings advances a mechanistic framework for understanding atmosphere–sea ice interactions across polar, mid-latitude, and tropical regions, and its role in shaping large-scale circulation and regional climate extremes.
