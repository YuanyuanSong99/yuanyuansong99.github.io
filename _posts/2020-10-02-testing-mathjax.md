As anthropogenic greenhouse gases increase heat retention in the Earth system, the ocean absorbs nearly 98% of the excess heat because of its large heat capacity. This stored heat manifests primarily as changes in ocean temperature. Understanding where and how ocean temperature changes occur is therefore central to assessing impacts on human activities and marine ecosystems. My research focuses on identifying the physical mechanisms that shape patterns of ocean temperature change under atmospheric forcing, and, in turn, examining how sea surface temperature anomalies feedback onto atmospheric circulation.

I investigated zonal differences in upper-ocean temperature changes in the Southern Ocean (south of 35°S) from the perspectives of both anthropogenic trends (Song et al., 2025, Nature Communications) and decadal internal variability (Song et al., 2024, JC). These studies provide a new perspective of pronounced zonal contrasts between the Atlantic–Indian Ocean and Pacific sectors, which had been largely overlooked due to the prevalent use of zonal-mean diagnostics focused on meridional structures. Using a hierarchy of large ensemble climate models (CESM2, CMIP6), stand-alone ocean modeling, and reanalysis datasets, I demonstrated that surface wind changes dominantly drive these zonal temperature contrasts via modulating ocean heat transport, rather than through local surface heat fluxes. This basin-scale temperature change heterogeneity has important implications for regional ocean warming, sea ice evolution, and the vulnerability of upper–Southern Ocean ecosystems.
