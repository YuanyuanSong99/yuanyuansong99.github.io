Hi, I'm currently a postdoc working on atmosphere-ocean dynamics. My research broadly explores how the ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice interact — connecting tropical variability, mid-latitude extremes, and polar change. I work across a wide range of timescales, including seasonal, interannual, and decadal variability, as well as long-term climate trends. I integrate coupled climate models, stand-alone ocean/atmosphere models, statistical diagnostics, observations and state estimates, with the goal of advancing a physically grounded understanding of the coupled Earth system.
